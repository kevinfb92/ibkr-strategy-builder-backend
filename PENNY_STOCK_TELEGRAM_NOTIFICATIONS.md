## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **New Components Created**:

1. **`penny_stock_notification_service.py`** - Core notification service
   - `send_buy_order_filled()` - Position opened notifications
   - `send_sell_order_filled()` - Position closed notifications  
   - `send_price_target_reached()` - Price target achievement notifications

2. **Enhanced `penny_stock_watcher.py`** - Order monitoring with notifications
   - Added async support for notification sending
   - Integrated buy/sell order detection and notification triggers
   - Automatically detects parent vs child orders

3. **Enhanced `penny_stock_price_monitor.py`** - Price monitoring with notifications
   - Added price target achievement notifications
   - Integrated with first target (breakeven) and last target (free runner) logic

### **Integration Points**:

- **Order Fills**: `penny_stock_watcher` → detects filled orders → sends notifications
- **Price Targets**: `penny_stock_price_monitor` → detects target hits → sends notifications  
- **Telegram Delivery**: Uses existing `telegram_service.send_lite_alert()` for clean message delivery

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Message Format**: 
- All messages labeled with **PENNYSTOCK** prefix
- Rich formatting with emojis and structured data
- Automatic P&L calculation for sell notifications
- Strategy metadata inclusion (entry price, targets, free runner status)

### **Notification Triggers**:
```python
# Buy order filled (position opened)
await penny_stock_notification_service.send_buy_order_filled(ticker, order_data, strategy_data)

# Sell order filled (position closed)  
await penny_stock_notification_service.send_sell_order_filled(ticker, order_data, strategy_data)

# Price target reached
await penny_stock_notification_service.send_price_target_reached(
    ticker, target_price, current_price, strategy_data, action_taken
)
```

## 🧪 **Testing**

Created comprehensive test scripts:
- **`test_penny_notifications.py`** - Notification system testing

2. **Price Monitor** tracks targets and sends achievement notifications  
3. **Clean Message Format** clearly distinguishes penny stock alerts from option alerts
